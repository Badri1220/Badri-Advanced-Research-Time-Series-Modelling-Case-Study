# Badri-Advanced-Research-Time-Series-Modelling-Case-Study
The goal is to analyze the two datasets and forecast using them for 24 months ahead of accurate prediction and for comparison of different modeling strategies.

The results shown in this analysis were able to prove the effectiveness of both traditional
ARIMA and neural network-based LSTM models in forecasting time series data. ARIMA
gave a good reliable, interpretable baseline, but the LSTM model outperformed both Johnson
&amp; Johnson sales as well as Amazon stock price datasets consistently. LSTM was better at
inferring complex patterns and non-linearities, factors of interest in seasonality and trends.
Although LSTM models were computationally more intensive, the cost was worth it as the
state-of-the-art models in forecasting were improved. This has important implications for the
time series forecasting problem in a variable business environment because these findings
indicate that deep learning is a viable alternative.
